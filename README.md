## 🎯 What I Do

**I build AI agents.**

With 20+ years in the IT industry—much of it within the Salesforce ecosystem—I focus on creating intelligent systems that can navigate enterprise complexity. My work sits at the intersection of **Agentforce**, **Data Cloud**, **Systems Architecture**, **Prompt Engineering**, and **Context Efficiency**.

I lead a team of PreSales Technical Architects who help customers design and implement end-to-end data and AI strategies, leveraging the full capabilities of Salesforce Data Cloud across the **U.S.** and **Canada**.

Our team brings deep expertise in **Data Platforms**, **Trusted AI**, and **AI-powered Agents**, enabling organizations to maximize the value of their data. We support customers across **Financial Services**, **Healthcare and Life Sciences**, and **Insurance**.

Through strategic guidance and hands-on partnership, we help organizations drive innovation, scale AI adoption, and deliver meaningful business outcomes—while staying current with emerging technology.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

Mostly web apps and AI agents using Salesforce tech — Data Cloud, Agentforce, Apex, LWC, and whatever else gets the job done.

I also tinker with personal projects and automations that make my work (and life) a little easier. Always experimenting, always testing out the latest tools and tech to see what sticks.
