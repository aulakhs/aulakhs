## 🎯 What I Do

**I build AI agents**

With 15+ years deep in the Salesforce ecosystem and a CTA certification, I focus on creating intelligent systems that understand enterprise complexity. My work lives at the intersection of **Agentforce**, **RAG architectures**, **Prompt Engineering** and **Context Efficiency**.

I lead a team of PreSales Technical Architects dedicated to assisting customers in designing and implementing comprehensive data and AI strategies, leveraging the full capabilities of Salesforce's Data Cloud across **AMER**, **Canada**, and **LATAM**.

My team possesses extensive expertise in **Data Platforms**, **Trusted AI**, and **AI-powered Agents**, enabling organizations to maximize the value of their data. We support customers across **Financial Services**, **Healthcare**, **Retail & Consumer Goods**, **Manufacturing**, **Automotive**, and **Energy** industries.

By providing strategic guidance, we help organizations drive innovation, scale AI adoption, and achieve meaningful business outcomes while staying at the forefront of technological advancements.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

Mostly web apps and AI agents using Salesforce tech — Data Cloud, Agentforce, Apex, LWC, and whatever else gets the job done.

I also tinker with personal projects and automations that make my work (and life) a little easier. Always experimenting, always testing out the latest tools and tech to see what sticks.
